# SIOControl Firmware
This firmware is designed to work with the SIOControl PlugIn for OctoPrint. It could be used for general control from any device that can send commands over a serial line. 

There are several versions listed. Each targeting a specific board. These boards can be obtained though my [Tindie store front](https://www.tindie.com/stores/softwaresedge/) or in a number of other places.
One of the goals of this project is to make it easy for people that dont have the ability to just build out a control board. This is why I have setup the Tindie store. 
If you have a board / MCU you perfer, you likley can just modify the Firmware and get moving. Knowing what MCU is on that board should give you a good starting point if you have another board with the same MCU.


If you are looking for some support, I will be working on the wiki. Check it out. If you dont find what you are looking for there, I lurk a lot on the [OctoPrint community site](https://community.octoprint.org/). Post there in the plugins section and I will likely see it and respond. 


### Note that as up version 1.1.2 (2-26-2024) The SIO_ESP32WRM_Relay_x(n) firmware requires the latest ESP32 boards lib to support PWM Output being developed.
