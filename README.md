# SIOControl Firmware
This firmware is designed to work with the SIOControl PlugIn for OctoPrint. It could be used for general control from any device that can send commands over a serial line. 

There are several versions listed. Each targeting a specific board. Knowing what MCU is on that board should give you a good starting point if you have another board with the same MCU.

If you are looking for some support, I will be working on the wiki. Check it out. If you dont find what you are looking for there, I lurk a lot on the [OctoPrint community site](https://community.octoprint.org/). Post there in the plugins section and I will likely see it and respond.
